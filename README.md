# AutoClaim AI – Autonomous Insurance Claim Processing Agent

## Overview
AutoClaim AI is an autonomous agent built on **Inya.ai** that automates the insurance claim processing workflow. It verifies documents, extracts claim details, checks policy rules against IRDAI guidelines, detects missing data or fraud, and provides real-time claim status updates — reducing manual processing time from days to minutes.
